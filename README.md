I'm [Alan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-mckenna-scot/), a software engineer at [Encompass Corporation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/encompass-corporation/).

## Standards
- I like to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to help others understand my changes more easily
- I also follow [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) when reviewing other's code, to help standardise the PR process
